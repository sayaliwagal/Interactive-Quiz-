Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the quiz interface and defining content placeholders.

CSS3: For styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface across various devices.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all core logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous data fetching (Fetch API), answer validation, score calculation, and quiz state management.

How to Run Locally
To run this quiz application on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository (if applicable) or Download the Files:
If this project is hosted on a platform like GitHub, clone it:

git clone [repository-url]
cd interactive-quiz-app

Otherwise, ensure you have downloaded all project files (index.html, style.css, script.js, questions.json) into a single folder.

Install a Local Web Server:
Due to browser security restrictions (CORS) when fetching local JSON files, you cannot simply open index.html directly in your browser. You need a local web server.

Recommended: Use the "Live Server" extension for VS Code.

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Right-click on index.html in the Explorer.

Select "Open with Live Server".

Alternatively (Python): If you have Python installed, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

python -m http.server

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

Open in Browser:
Once the local server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by your server (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html if using Live Server, or http://localhost:8000/index.html for Python's http.server).
